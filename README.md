# TM1638BVN
A rewrite of the TM1638Custom library - https://github.com/MrLoba81/TM1638Custom
The codebase has been grabbed from the great [tm1638-library](https://github.com/rjbatista/tm1638-library) by [rjbatista](https://github.com/rjbatista)
This library has been developed in order to add specific functionalities for the [BVN display](https://katodo.com/it/lcd-tft-oled-display/656-display-led-8-cifre-8-segmenti-8-led-generici-bvn-s392rg2.html) that you can buy on [katodostore](https://katodo.com/it/)
